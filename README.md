What's this?
------------

The core of the ZIBMolPy package is an implementation of the efficient, adaptive sampling algorithm ZIBgridfree, designed for characterizing the conformational space of molecules.

The original ZIBgridfree algorithm was designed by Marcus Weber and Holger Meyer in 2005, and, over the years, has been enhanced by Alexander Riemer, Susanna Röblitz and Lionel Walter. The theoretical framework of ZIBgridfree is provided by Conformation Dynamics, an idea coined by Peter Deuflhard and Christoph Schütte.

This implementation represents an evolution of the original ZIBgridfree as it couples the original algorithm to the state-of-the-art molecular dynamics engine Gromacs. This creates the possibility to apply ZIBgridfree to very large molecular systems.
